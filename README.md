Implementation of the [$1 Gesture Recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/), a template based gesture recognition, for [Processing](http://processing.org/).


## About

The [$1 Gesture Recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/) is a research project by Wobbrock, Wilson and Li of the University of Washington and Microsoft Research. It describes a simple algorithm for accurate and fast recognition of drawn gestures.

Gestures can be recognised at any position, scale, and under any rotation. The system requires little training, achieving a 97% recognition rate with only one template for each gesture.
